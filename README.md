**Data quality navigated machine learning strategy with chemical intuition to improve generalization**

We provided the source codes of data processing techniques including the data diversity evaluation, the data split technique, and the data filtering method.
  ---'data split.ipynb' is the code for data split.
  ---'data filtering.ipynb' is the code for data filtering.
  ---'data diversity.ipynb' is the code for evaluations of data diversity.

'DFE-DL' include the code for training and testing our ensemble model. 

Please modify the paths in code according to your own file directory.

Other details are described in our paper.
